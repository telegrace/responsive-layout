# Responsive Layout

Here I'm creating my go to boiler plate for a responsive layout.

`git clone git@github.com:telegrace/responsive-layout.git`

`npm i`

### create-pages.py?

This can be used as standalone script to create page files from a `JSON` file. Just run `python3 create-pages.py` at the root of the project folder. The defaults values assume you have a React project and that your page names will be under title.
